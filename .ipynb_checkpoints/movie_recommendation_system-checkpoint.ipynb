Ultimately we want to characterize this using linear regression, meaning, we want to understand which user will most likely give the movie the highest rating. We'll start by using the ratings DataFrame and concatenating as we go. A few things to note. We... probably don't need to use the timestamp, as we're not as interested in the time series data. Also, we know we're going to have to one-hot encode the genre information, as well as the tags. The genre info is limited to the 19 categories, the tags on the other hand, have over 1589 unique values. We might be able to clean some of these up, but that is still quite a lot.\n",
